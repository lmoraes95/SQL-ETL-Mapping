# SQL-ETL-Mapping

The goal of this project was to complete an ETL process on a data set.

I found a data source and extracted data. Namely, IMBD and Netflix movies data set.

Transformed the data by cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating it.

The project was mostly done in SQL and SQL-Alchemy
